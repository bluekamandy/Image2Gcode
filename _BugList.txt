List of Bugs to Fix
--

FIXED 1.) GCode string precision error. Why scientific notation?

GCode is being parsed with scientific notation for some reason.
  For example: G0 F9000 X1.3e+02 Y4

FIXED 2.) Plastic is being over extruded on right side of 3d print.

FIXED 3.) Image is cropped

Need to go over data extraction and casting with OpenCV data types. I also need to learn proper grayscale conversion. The various image data types in OpenCV are essential to learn if you don't want them to trip you up.

4.) Layer height doesn't allow image to stick to itself.

5.) Difference between warp and weft isn't great enough.

Possible problems

1.) Might be better to integrate the slicer with the print object.
2.) Include descriptions of what's being printed in GCode to make it easier to follow.
